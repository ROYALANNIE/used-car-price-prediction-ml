# used-car-price-prediction-ml
A machine learning project to predict used car prices using regression models. Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualized with Seaborn &amp; Matplotlib.
Here’s a well-detailed README file for your car price prediction project, plus a suggested repo name and short project description for GitHub.

🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

This project is focused on predicting the selling price of used cars using machine learning. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

📌 Objective

To build a regression model that accurately predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features like car model, year, fuel type, kilometers driven, etc.

🔍 Project Steps

1. Data Cleaning  
   - Handling missing values
   - - Removing duplicates  
   - Converting data types

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Understanding feature relationships  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Outlier detection

3. Feature Engineering  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Creating new features (e.g., car age)

4. Modeling  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost Regressor (if used)

5. Model Evaluation  
   - MAE, MSE, RMSE  
   - R² Score  
   - Cross-validation

6. Deployment Preparation  
   - Saving the model using joblib or pickle  
   - Preparing final CSV submission
